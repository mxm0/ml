b)
The score in a is bigger than in c, probably because of the header in the emails says a lot about the text.
LinearSVC needs more time in b.

No algorithm outperforms another one.
Generally it is not surprising that when algorithms need more time they reach a higher score.
What comes to mind is the high calculation time (training and test) for RandomForestClassifier.
