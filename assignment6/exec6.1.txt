In order to configure the SVM you first need to create the object SVC and specifiy the kernel to use. For instance if we wanted to configure the SVM to be a classifier and use a linear kernel we'd type: SVC(kernel = "linear"). At the same time during creation you can configure the different parameters like C, gamma and polynomial degree depending on the kernel used.

In order to train the SVM then the fit() function has to be caleed, which takes as input the training data.

Classification of test points can be executed by calling the function predict(), which obviously takes the test points as input.

The support vectors can be accessed by the attribute support_vectors_ on the SVM object.	

The SVM from sklearn support multi-class classification by default as long as the input data into different "classes".
